## 2 - Working with projects

### 2.1 - Listing projects

List all project that user has permissions

```
curl -i https://qax.anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects 
-H'content-type:application/json' 
-H'Authorization:Bearer <token>'

-H'x-owner-id: <user-id>'

### 2.2 - Creating a project

Send the project name along with the classifier `raml` or `raml-fragment` depending on the type of project you have.
The type can be used in the case of the `raml-fragment`, to specify the concret fragment type.

Creating an spec:
```
curl 'https://qax.anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects' 
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' 
-H 'x-organization-id: <org-id>' 
-H 'x-owner-id: <user-id>' 
-H 'accept: application/json'
--data-binary '{"name":"My New Project", "classifier":"raml"}' 
--compressed
```

The following query parameters could be used for filtering, sorting and paging:

- `searchTerm`: Filter by project name containing the given term.
- `orderBy`: Sort results by project name, type, updated date (Valid values: name, type, updateDate (- = DESC / + = ASC)).
- `pageSize`: Quantity of items to return per page.
- `pageIndex`: Page to return (zero based).
- `validProjectTypes`: Filter by a comma-separated list of project types (Valid values: Mule_Application, raml, raml-fragment, evented-api).


Creating a fragment:
```
curl 'https://qax.anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects'

--compressed
```


Expect a 201 response code, with a json that has an `id` property, representing the project id. 
This `id` can then be used to operate on the project.

### 2.3 - Removing a project

## 3 - Reading branch content 

For all this operations, you will need the project id and the branch name.

## 4 - Writing branch content 

For all this operations, you will need the project id and the branch name.

### 4.1 - Acquiring the lock

To avoid edition conflicts, the branches edition has a lock. To edit a branch, you first need to request the edition lock over it.

```
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch>/acquireLock'

```

Expect a `200` with:
```
{ locked: true, name: "<user-name>" }
```

### 4.2 - Creating or updating a file

```
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch>/save' 
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
-H 'x-organization-id: <org-id>' 
-H 'x-owner-id: <owner-id>'

Expect a `200` response, with the list of files from the branch.

### 4.3 - Moving or renaming a file

`file-path` must be uri complain. `/` in file-path must be escaped


```
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch>/files/<file-path>/move' 
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
-H 'x-organization-id: <org-id>' 
-H 'x-owner-id: <owner-id>' 
-H 'accept: application/json'
--data-binary '{"path":"moved-api.raml"}'
--compressed
```

Expect a `200` response code.

### 4.4 - Deleting a file

`file-path` must be uri complain. `/` in file-path must be escaped

If `file-path` is a folder, it will delete all the content too.

```
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch>/files/<file-path>' 
-X DELETE 
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' 
-H 'x-organization-id: <org-id>'
-H 'x-owner-id: <owner-id>' 
--compressed
```

Expect a `200` response code.

### 4.5 - Mantaining the write lock

The lock over a branch will only lst for a minute, and will expire afterwards.
To mantain the lock over a branch, a call needs to be made.

```
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch>/status'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' 
-H 'x-organization-id: <org-id>' 
-H 'x-owner-id: <owner-id>' 
-H 'accept: application/json'
--data-binary '{}' --compressed
```

This will return a `200` with he lock information:
```
{lock: {locked: true, lockedBy: "<my-user-name>", lockedByMe: true}
```

### 4.6 - Releasing the write lock

After edition over the branch is done, the lock can be released manually. If this is not done, the lock will still expire.

```
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/designcenter/api-designer/projects/<proejct-id>/branches/<branch>/releaseLock' 
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
-H 'x-organization-id: <org-id>' 
-H 'x-owner-id: <owner-id>' 
-H 'accept: application/json'
--data-binary '{}' --compressed
```

Expect a `200` response code.
